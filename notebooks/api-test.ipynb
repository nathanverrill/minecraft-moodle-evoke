    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this `Jupyter notebook` is to test the `Moodle API`. Moodle is a commonly used learning management system and used by the World Bank, for EVOKE, in the early 2020s. Tests are programmed in Python and use the ` `moodlepy` Python module. The module is available via pip and code here: https://github.com/hexatester/moodlepy\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to use the Moodle API to provide an exciting, gameful experience for EVOKE players and students. Creating a rich experience is very difficult, if not impossible, in Moodle, and Moodle does not use modern coding frameworks - it's still `PHP`, and not `.NET Core`, `Django`, or similar. Fortunately Moodle does expose a number of `REST API` endpoints that return data in `JSON` format.\n",
    " \n",
    "This API sets the stage for 'big thinking' integration with AAA game titles. One example is providing players with a Minecraft in-game reward when a Moodle badge is earned.\n",
